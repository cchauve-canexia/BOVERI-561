# Analysis of the new indel caller on Horizon and SeraSeq commercial dilution series
Cedric Chauve
February 20, 2021  

This document describes the results of the new indel caller on a set of runs
obtained from Horizon and SeraSeq commercial samples, diluted at various levels
of DNA input and expected VAF.

## Methods and data

### Data
There are 15 different set of samples that were analyzed in this experiment,
defined by a range of DNA input and a range of expected VAF:
- DNA input (in ng): (0, 4], (4, 8], (8, 16], (16, 32], (32, 64]
- expected VAF: (0.0, 0.5], (0.5, 1.0], (1.0, 5.0]
Note: there were no expected indel with expected VAF above 5%.

For each setting defined by a DNA input range and an expected VAF, all samples
sequenced with that setting were considered as a dataset. The LLOD was defined
as max(0.25, 0.5 * min_VAF) where min_VAF is the lowest expected VAF among all
expected indels in these samples.

For these samples, the indels detected by the new indel caller were extracted
from the pipeline result files.

### Methods
To each detected indel, a score (that should  actually be called a penalty)
is associated defined as the sum of 4 terms:
- weighted sequence complexity penalty, defined as the sequence complexity
  penalty weighted by a multiplicative factor W in [0.0, 1.0]
- support penalty (nb reads in largest supporting cluster / number of supporting
  reads),
- overlap penalty (min(1.0, cumulative VAF of overlapping indels / VAF)),
- control penalty (min(1.0, closest VAF observed in a control sample / VAF)),

For a given score threshold S, every detected with a score <= X is called.

The performance of the indel caller was explored, for each setting, within a
grid of values for S and W:
- S ranges from 0.0 to 2.0 by increments of 0.1,
- W ranges from 0.0 to 1.0 by increments of 0.1.

The detected indels were filtered to remove any indel detected with a low VAF
(VAF < LLOD).

The following classes of indels are then recorder:
- TP: an expected indel that is called,
- FP: a called indel which is not an expected indel,
- TN: a detected indel which is not expected and not called,
- FN_u: an expected indel which is not dectected (and thus not called),
- FN_d: an expected indel which is detected but not called (score > S).
- FN = FN_u + FN_d
Note that FN_u could then contain indels that were initially detected by the
indel caller but with a VAF that would be too low to call it for the given LLOD.

Remark. Three indels observed as high frequency FP indels in a previous
experiment were also filtered out from detected indels:
- chr19 4117563 GCTT  G
- chr15 90631917  TC T
- chr12 25398297  C CCG

From these statistics, for each setting the following quantities were computed:
- sensitivity: TP / (TP + FN),
- specificity: TN / (TN + FP),
- accuracy: (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN),
- precision / Positive Predictive Value (PPV): TP / (TP + FP),
- recall: TP / (TP + FN)
- F1: 2 * precision * recall / (precision + recall),
- FDR: FP / (TP + FP) = 1.0 - precision = 1.0 - PPV,

## Results

For each combination of VAF and DNA input, two files are available, one that
shows the statistics described above for all combinations (S, W) and one that
shows all FP and FN. The table below provides a snapshot of these results.

In this table, the VAF range is in the first two columns, the DNA input
range in columns 3 and 4, score of the threshold S and w_comp stands fo the
weight facto for the sequence complexity penalty W.

For each setting the table show the 10 best combinations (S, W) in terms of the
difference F1 - FDR.

The first important observation is that for an expected VAF of at least 1% and
any DNA input amount, the new indel caller performs very well in the sense that
there is a wide range of combinations (S, W) for which it reaches an  F1 above
0.9 and an FDR below 5%. Only a subset of 10 of these combinations is shown
in this document, the full results are available in the TSV result files.

For the VAF range (0.5, 1.0] the results are slightly less good but still very
good for a DNA input of at least 4ng. For the DNA input range (4ng, 8ng], the
drop in performance is due to a handful of FPs that increase the FDR to 12%.
The results drop significantly for a DNA input of less than 4ng, where not
surprisingly most FN are actually undetected, but the number of FP is large.

Last, for an expected VAF below 0.5%, the results are decent for a DNA input of
at least 8ng. The range of combinations (S, W) that provides good results is
much narrower. Again, as expected, most FN are undetected, likely due to their
low expected VAF. Below 8ng, the results are characterized by a large number of
FP.
